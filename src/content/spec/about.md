# About

Welcome to **BTTA Project Journal** â€” a personal technical blog by Diego Bautista.

This space is dedicated to documenting real-world engineering projects, sharing reflections, and exploring the practical application of DevOps, embedded systems, container orchestration, distributed infrastructure, and IoT-related workflows.

Each post is based on hands-on experimentation with tools like Docker, Linux, NFS, Ansible, and more. The blog complements my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/DiegoBtta101) by providing the full context behind each build: motivations, architecture, lessons learned, and possible improvements.

> If you're curious about how things are made under the hood â€” not just what was built â€” this blog is for you.
